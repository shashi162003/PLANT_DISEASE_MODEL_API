        "Disease Name": "Apple Scab",
        "Cause (bacteria/fungi/virus/pest)": "Fungal : caused by Venturia inaequalis, an ascomycete fungus that overwinters as pseudothecia in fallen leaves and releases ascospores in spring during wet conditions.",
        "Commonly Affects (plants, regions)": "Apple trees (Malus domestica); primarily affects leaves, fruit, and occasionally twigs in temperate regions with cool, wet springs, such as North America and Europe.",
        "Symptoms (visual + early signs)": "Early signs include small, olive-green spots on the upper leaf surfaces within 10-14 days of infection, turning black and velvety as they mature. Spots may coalesce into larger, rough, scabby lesions. On fruit, dark, sunken blemishes form, often cracking or deforming the apple. Severe infections cause premature leaf yellowing and drop, reducing photosynthesis and tree vigor.",
        "How to Cure / Treat": "Initiate fungicide applications at bud break, using captan, myclobutanil, or sulfur-based products, and continue every 7-14 days during wet periods, especially from petal fall to early fruit development. Remove and destroy infected leaves, fruit, and twigs to reduce fungal inoculum. In organic systems, apply sulfur or lime-sulfur sprays, supplemented by Bacillus subtilis as a biological control. Avoid spraying during bloom to protect pollinators.",
        "Prevention Tips": "Enhance air circulation by pruning trees annually in late winter to open the canopy, reducing humidity around foliage. Collect and destroy fallen leaves and infected fruit in autumn to eliminate overwintering spores. Plant resistant varieties like 'Enterprise', 'Liberty', 'Freedom', or 'GoldRush'. Avoid overhead irrigation; use drip systems to keep leaves dry. Apply preventative fungicides before forecasted rain, guided by disease forecasting models like the Mills Table.",
        "Recommended Pesticides/Fertilizers": "Captan (1-2 lbs per 100 gallons of water, applied every 7-10 days during wet periods), Myclobutanil (systemic, 10-14 day intervals, follow label rates), Sulfur-based fungicides (organic, 2-3 lbs per 100 gallons, ensure thorough coverage).
